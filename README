=================

printf() implementation as a multiboot kernel

Dependencies
------------

  - make
  - a i686-elf-gcc in your $PATH
  - grub(2) (for creating a bootable image)


Building
--------

  - To build only the multiboot kernel:
     $ make kernel

  - To build a bootable iso image:
     $ make image
    or
     $ make

  - You can switch between VGA and Serial output on the COM1 Port by setting
    CONSOLE to either `vga` or `serial`. Default is `vga`.

  - If your grub utils start with grub- instead of grub2-, add the following:
     $ make GRUB_PREFIX=grub ...

Running tests
